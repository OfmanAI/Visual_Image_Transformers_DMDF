TLDR Using the newly released DMDF_V1, Deepmedia AI endeavored to test the effectiveness of modern deepfake detection techniques on a wide variety of deepfake detection datasets. To accomplish this, we trained a Cross Efficient Visual Image Transformer based upon the architecture released by Davide Coccomini on 8 different deepfake detection datasets, containing over 10,000 fake videos and 6900 real videos. Below contains the first stage results of this machine learning architecture on the first version of DMDF. Though the results are quite promising, we intend to update this deepfake detection effort as DMDF contains to be updated to ensure that our deepfake detectors are being trained on the most sophisticated deepfakes in the wild. For more information, please see the attached white paper as well as the DMDF github page.
